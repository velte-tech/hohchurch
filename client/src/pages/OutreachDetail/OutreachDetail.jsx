            <h2>Highway House</h2>
            <p>
              One of the major projects we run as a church is, Highway House –
              once a homeless shelter that accommodated up 40 residents per
              night, post COVID, it now functions as a day centre for those who
              are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The day centre is open
              every Tuesday and Friday between 11am – 3pm on our church
              premises; where our support workers and volunteers offer a helping
              hand to those who visit. This ranges from teas and coffee’s,
              showering, providing clean clothes and bedding to immigration
              support, health care needs and employment and housing support.{" "}
              <br />
              <br />
              Highway House was birthed out of an evangelism outreach session
              that took place in the winter of 2009. During this session Pastor
              that took place in the winter of 2009. During this session Pastor
              Dorcas came across two homeless men, Chris and Lec, whom she
              approached to share the gospel she then went a step further to
              invite them to our church premises to meet with Pastor Alex. At
              this meeting they got to know them more, they spoke about their
              backgrounds, their families and the circumstances that lead them
              to homelessness and prayed with them concerning their needs.{" "}
              <br /> <br />
              After this meeting Pastor sensed there was a true and urgent need
              to help these men; to gain confidence in themselves and restore
              their dignity, to help fight the addiction of alcohol, and to
              cater to their physical needs of food, clothing and cleaning
              facilities but most of all for the good news of salvation. This
              led to us converting one of our toilets in church into a shower
              room, providing food and companionship to these men. As we
              supported them we shared the faith and many assimilated into our
              church, got baptised and worshiped. <br />
              <br />
              Fast forward to today this present day we have helped almost 1000
              people have been helped with shelter, food and counselling, along
              with the opportunity for much needed companionship with others. To

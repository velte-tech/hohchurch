    question: "What should I wear",
    answer:
      "We don't have a dress code. If you're wearing jeans, hats, or an old beer shirt, you'll fit right in. Get ready for some very opinionated sports enthusiasts if you decide to pick a team, though. ",

  {
    question: "Whats the music like?",
    answer:
      "Our bands rock (we're a little biased)! It'll be upbeat and probably louder than you expected but earplugs are available at the doors. You'll hear a few worship songs during the service and even maybe a cover tune so feel free to sing along or participate however you feel most comfortable. Lyrics will be on the screens.",
